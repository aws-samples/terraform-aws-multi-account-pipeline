# Troubleshooting

| Issue | Fix |
|---|---|
| Failed lint or validate | Read the report or logs to discover why the code has failed, then make a new commit. |
| Failed fmt | This means your code is not formatted. Run `terraform fmt --recursive` on your code, then make a new commit. |
| Failed SAST | Read the Checkov logs (Details > Reports) and either make the correction in code or add a skip to the module inputs. |
| Failed plan or apply stage | Read the report or logs to discover error in terraform code, then make a new commit. |
| Pipeline fails on apply with `the action failed because no branch named main was found ...` | Either nothing has been committed to the repo or the branch is incorrect (Eg using `Master` not `Main`). Either commit to the Main branch or change the module input to fix this. |
| `Invalid count argument` for `aws_s3_bucket_server_side_encryption_configuration` | The AWS KMS key must exist before the pipeline is created. If you create both at the same time, there is a dependency issue. |
| Unable to find state file | Check state storage :env > AWS Account ID > backend key |
